## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I can use CSS resets and custom properties

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
:root{
  --clr-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --clr-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  --clr-cyan:  hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  --clr-main-bg: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
  --clr-card-bg:  hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  --clr-dark-line:  hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSSmatic.com](https://www.cssmatic.com/) - This helped me generate the box shadow of my card
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This person teached me how to use custom properties in CSS. He helped me (as he says) to fall madly deeply inlove with CSS
